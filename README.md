# PITZA-BERRA

This website I have created is for a restaurant of my own creation that I would like to have someday.
I have made it for a wide target audience of food lovers who also enjoy drinking, I wanted to encorporate a mix and match idea so that it would suite everyone's satisfaction.
Whether it's to just come in and relax, have a pint or to come and enjoy a luxurios meal!

Users of the website can find all the infomation they need to know about my restaurant, such as how to be in contact, opening times and days we operate, our social media for updates on specials and make reservations.
