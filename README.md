This website I have created is for a restaurant of my own creation that I would like to have someday.
I have made it for a wide target audience of food lovers who also enjoy drinking, I wanted to encorporate a mix and match idea so that it would suite everyone's satisfaction.
Whether it's to just come in and relax, have a pint or to come and enjoy a luxurios meal!

Users of the website can find all the infomation they need to know about my restaurant, such as how to be in contact, opening times and days we operate, our social media for updates on specials and make reservations.

# User Experience (UX)  
## User Stories  
- As a user, I want to understand what the business is at first look.  
- As a user, I want to see what is avaliable to order.  
- As a user, I want to be able to get in contact with the busnines through a contact.   
- As a user, I want to be able to find the business with a location.  
- As a user, I want to be able to make a reservation using a form.  

## Design  
### Colour Scheme  
Colours used I wanted to stick to a tasty colour palette for this site, utilizing the hero image background as much as possible to draw a user in and give a direct understanding to the website from the get go of launch.

### Imagery  
Visual representations are an important part of the user experience for this project, used to draw a potential client in.

The welcome  image is used to convey a feeling of a broader sense of Palate, rather than be informative.
The logo in the header is used to build the business brand, a simple icon that can be used across multipl platforms.

### Overall Feel  
The main objective in creating the site was to have it look elegant and simplistic for easy navigation, while still providing the user with all of the information one would want at first sight.

# FEATURES  
## Current Features  
At the top of the page I have my navigation bar, which contains the Home, Menu, Gallery, Contact and Reservations.
Each navigation will take you to the section within the page, however the Reservation nav will take you to a new Tab to make a reservation for the restaurant.
Navigation on Social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) which will open in new tabs to each individual social media's.

The welcome area on the hompage looks good on all devices. This is the main introduction to the brand and sets a nice tone for the business brand.

The price list is clear and visable on the home page.

Treatments have their own page, laid out in cards to allow the user to browse through. 'Read More' option is available and opens a modal with further information.
As a user, I want to be able to contact someone to ask about specific treatments and understand if they are appropriate for me.

The contact form allows the user to select which treatment they are interested and sent a message to salon with their question.

Social link on the footer onall pages will allow the user to PM or DM the business through social media.
